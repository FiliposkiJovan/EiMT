# EiMT - correctSpringTemplate

# READ THE WIKI

This branch is made to fully integrate the correct Spring Template in our code. On this branch we will _Reformat and Update_ the code, while also implementing the _Domain-Repository-Service-Controller_ pattern

# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, DO NOT EXPECT IT TO WORK

Each Laboratory Exercise will be wrapped in a module (ex. Laboratory 1 is saved in KB_EiMT_Lab01)
